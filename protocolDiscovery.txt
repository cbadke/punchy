general format:
cc - command code
nn - value
F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 cc nn [nn2 nn3 ...] F7

Manual trigger of 'recording' or 'ready' light:
cc = 08
nn = 0 // turn the light off
nn = 1 // turn the 'ready' light on
nn = 2 // turn the 'recording' light on

Set the light dimming level (common):
cc = 02
nn = 1 .. 7F (1 - max brightness, 7F - min brightness)

Set colour:
cc = 40 + colour channel + light index
nn = 1 .. 7F (1 - max, 7F - min; the meaning is actually the amount of dimming of particular colour channel)
colour channel: Red ~ 0, Green ~ 10, Blue ~ 20
light index: 'recording' ~ 0, 'ready' ~ 1, 'cue' ~ 2, 'note1' ~ 3, 'note2' ~ 4...

Any colour command will automatically turn the light on for about 1-2 seconds for the live preview purpose (but the light can be turned off by manual trigger command even during this preview interval).
RGB values for a given light are stored in EEPROM, so once you set it, it is retained even after you unplug and replug the device.
The common brightness (Dim level) value is also stored in EEPROM.
(The actual storage to EEPROM is delayed, so if there are many continuous changes, the EEPROM won't suffer from excessive overwrites - it's protected.)
Please note that combinations of RGB values can affect the brightness.

An example how to turn the lamp on to orange using the 'recording' light:
F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 40 01 F7 // set the red channel of 'recording' light to 01 (minimal dim = max presence)
F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 50 40 F7 // set the green channel of 'recording' light to 40 (middle)
F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 60 7F F7 // set the blue channel of 'recording' light to 7F (maximal dim = no presence)
F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 08 02 F7 // keep the 'recording' light on

F0 7E 00 07 02 01 00 03 08 00 F7 // turn the light off

Lamp RGB values 01407F correspond to traditional RGB values FF7F00.
Classic RGB values need to be reversed, scaled down and shifted to start from 1.
